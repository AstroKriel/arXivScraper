I study how magnetic fields shape astrophysical systems by mediating amplification, transport, and feedback across scales. Contexts include the ISM, ICM, accretion disks, jets, and molecular clouds. I’m interested in theoretical models and MHD simulations that explain mechanisms and scalings.

What I’m looking for:
- Magnetic field amplification: “small-scale dynamo”, “mean-field dynamo”, “MRI and angular-momentum transport”.
- Magnetized turbulence & energy transfer: “dynamical alignment”, “velocity–magnetic alignment”, “cross-helicity”, “scale-dependent alignment”, “Maxwell vs Reynolds stresses”, “pressure–strain coupling”, “Alfvénic cascade”, “reconnection-mediated transfer”.
- Multi-scale structuring and evolution: anisotropy, intermittency, and how fields organize structure from “molecular clouds” to “galaxies” and “clusters”.
- Non-ideal MHD that materially changes dynamics: “ambipolar diffusion”, “Hall MHD”, “Ohmic diffusion”.
- Studies that connect mechanisms to consequences for system evolution (e.g., star formation regulation, ISM/ICM heating, transport).

Methods preference: theory and numerical MHD (DNS/LES), instability analyses, scaling laws. Observation-driven work is relevant when it tests or constrains magnetic mechanisms.

Key phrases the model may quote:

“dynamical alignment”, “cross-helicity”, “scale-dependent alignment”,
“Maxwell vs Reynolds stresses”, “pressure–strain coupling”,
“Alfvénic cascade”, “reconnection-mediated transfer”,
“ambipolar diffusion”, “Hall MHD”, “ISM”, “ICM”.
